    <h3>Ingredients Required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
          1 cup toor dal (split pigeon peas)
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup rice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>2 dried red chilies</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon hing (asafoetida)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cashews</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 potato, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the toor dal and rice in cold water until the water runs clear. This removes any impurities and ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li>In a pressure cooker, combine the cleaned dal, rice, turmeric powder, and enough water to cover the ingredients by at least 2 inches. Close the lid and bring to high pressure. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 whistles. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release any remaining manually.</li>
        <li>While the rice and dal cook, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop. This adds a pleasant crackling sound and nutty aroma.</li>
        <li>Add the dried red chilies and hing (asafoetida) to the hot oil and cook for a few seconds. These spices release their vibrant flavors and aromas quickly.</li>
        <li>Add the peanuts and cashews to the pan and continue cooking until the peanuts slightly brown and the cashews soften. This adds a subtle richness and textural contrast.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent. Then, add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become slightly mushy and release their juices.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped carrots, potatoes, and cilantro, and cook for a couple of minutes to soften the vegetables while retaining a slight bite.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the cooked dal and rice mixture to the skillet and stir well to combine. Season with salt to taste, ensuring every bite is pleasantly balanced.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your hot Bisi Bele Bath with your favorite chutney or sambar, making it a complete and satisfying meal!</li>
